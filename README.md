# About this module:
This module was created for the **Australia’s Asian Garrisons**, based at Macquarie University, Sydney, and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. The module has been designed to record archival documents in degraded conditions. The archives were often without stable internet connection, without access to scanner / photocopier with the exception of mobile phone for taking pictures. The module upon export from the server compiles taken photos into PDF format and automatically attaches available metadata, and provides OCR text version of the scanned document.
