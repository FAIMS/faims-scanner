# Using FAIMS Scanner

## Getting started

1.  Ensure your device is connected to the internet (turn wifi on and connect).
2.  Make sure the FAIMS app is updated.
3.  Open the FAIMS app.
4.  Press ‘Show modules’ button and on the next screen ensure that the app says ‘Connected to faims2.fedarch.org:80’ at the top.
5.  If no server is named, you have no internet connection. You can collect records and sync them later when you have internet.
6.  If a different server is named, press the three vertical dots in the upper right corner and press ‘Settings’, use the ‘Select server’ drop-down menu to select ‘faims2.fedarch.org’, click on it and then press connect. If you get an error message, your internet is too poor. You can collect records and sync later when you have internet.
7.  Load the ‘FAIMS Scanner’ module (if necessary).
8.  Connect a Bluetooth keyboard (pair if necessary).
9.  Attach your phone to the ‘Magic Arm’ or to a tripod.
10. Use the app ‘Bubble level’ or similar to level the phone.
11. Return to FAIMS.

## Creating and viewing records

1.  In FAIMS Scanner, press ‘Create New Record’.
2.  Navigate out of FAIMS app and open your camera app.
3.  Take all photos of the current document. The ‘down volume’ key (F11 on the Anker Bluetooth keyboard) fires the camera shutter.
4.  Return to FAIMS app.
5.  In ‘Metadata’ tab press ‘Attach New Files’. You should get a confirmation message listing the new files found.
6.  Complete all metadata as required (on the ‘Metadata’ tab below the ‘Attach New Files’ button).
7.  When finished, press the ‘Back’ button.
8.  Press ‘Create New Record’ and repeat the process.
9.  To view existing records, select the ‘Search’ tab from the same screen where you create new records, press the search button, and select the desired record from the ‘Entity List’.

## Tips and tricks

* You may need to take the phone out of the case to get it to fit in the holder.
* Make sure the clamp on the holder isn’t pressing any buttons.
* Try locking the phone in portrait or landscape mode - whichever you find easiest to use.
* When scrolling, flick quickly so as not to activate dropdowns or date pickers, or use the whitespace we have added to the right side of the interface to assist scrolling.
* The Keyboard is great for filling in text fields, but takes some practice for dropdowns and checkboxes. If you want to use it:
* Tab moves you between fields (you may need to press it twice), or from one check box to the next in a list of checkboxes.
* ‘Enter’ opens a drop-down list, selects an entry from a drop-down, or checks a check box.
* Arrows scroll the screen or scroll through a drop-down list once you’ve selected it using ‘Enter’.
* The ‘ID’ field is an auto-incrementing record number (i.e., it goes up by one every time you make a new record). You can set your own ‘seed’ if you want - you can for example enter ‘1000’ for a second user/device so that his/her numbers are different.
* Long-press the ‘pencil’ icon next to any field in order to bring up an ‘annotation’ (a place you can write notes related to that field). You can use annotations to enter extra information, clarify things, take a note specifically related to a field, specify an ‘Other’ sub-theme, or write instructions about needed changes / improvements to the app (e.g., ‘XXX needs to be added as a new sub-theme under Gender’).
* If you want to write a general note about a source, use the ‘Notes’ tab.
* You should not have to use the ‘Files’ tab unless something goes wrong with automated file attachment. Call us first if that happens and we’ll try to fix it.
